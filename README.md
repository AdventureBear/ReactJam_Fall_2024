BASIC MATH
atk = attack + weapon + (abs(Base attack * (speed/10))) 

def = defense + armor + (abs(Base Defense * (speed/10))) 

speed = base speed, make icons move slightly faster

Dungeon crawler games are a subgenre of role-playing games (RPGs) that emphasize exploration, combat, and resource management within dungeon-like environments. Here are the key components that define the basics of dungeon crawlers: 

Game Structure 

Character Creation: Players typically start by creating a character, selecting attributes such as class, skills, and abilities. This process can influence gameplay significantly, as different classes may excel in combat, magic, or stealth. 

Dungeon Layout: The dungeon is often designed with various rooms and corridors, filled with monsters, traps, and treasures. The layout can include secret doors and hidden passages to encourage exploration and discovery. 

Exploration Phases: The gameplay usually follows a cycle of entering rooms, encountering enemies, and collecting loot. Each room may contain monsters to fight, puzzles to solve, or traps to avoid. 

Combat Mechanics 

Encounters: Combat is a central feature of dungeon crawlers. Players engage in turn-based or real-time battles against various enemies. Encounters can be designed to vary in difficulty, mixing easier and harder foes to maintain player engagement. 

Resource Management: Players must manage resources such as health points (HP), mana or energy for spells, and items like potions or weapons. This adds a layer of strategy as players decide when to use their limited resources. 

Turn Structure: In many games, combat follows a structured turn order where players and enemies take turns attacking or performing actions. This can involve drawing cards or rolling dice to determine outcomes. 

Game Elements 

Traps and Puzzles: Traps can add an element of surprise and challenge within the dungeon. Players may need to disarm traps or solve puzzles to progress through certain areas. 

Loot and Rewards: Defeating monsters often yields loot that can enhance the player's character or provide new abilities. Collecting treasure is a significant motivation for exploration. 

Story and Goals: Dungeon crawlers often have overarching narratives or specific goals that guide the player's journey through the dungeon, such as defeating a boss monster or retrieving a magical artifact. 

Tips for Playing Dungeon Crawlers 

Adaptability: Be prepared to improvise encounters based on player actions and decisions. 

Balance Difficulty: Mix encounters to create a rhythm of challenge that keeps players engaged without overwhelming them. 

Focus on Exploration: Encourage players to explore every corner of the dungeon by rewarding curiosity with hidden treasures or lore. 

Dungeon crawlers provide an engaging blend of strategy, combat, and exploration that appeals to fans of RPGs and adventure games alike.
